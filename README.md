# JIT Connect

* JIT CONNECT is a social media tool that allows you to stay in touch with your classmates, teachers, alumni, alumni teachers, and the entire college community.

* It's a website made up of several components of a social networking platform that have been combined to provide a space where people can interact, collaborate, and learn.

* The concept's major point is to connect current students with not just the college's alumni students, but also the college's alumni teachers.

* It also has a timeline for sharing news updates with the entire college, regardless of your batch, class, or year.
